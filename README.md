# PTrees
A software tool that creates complex pedigree structures and assigns individual level genetic panels corresponding to the familiar structure.


First, update the configuration file to whatever values you wish to see in your pedigree. From here, simply set your directory to the PTrees folder and execute the RScript Entitled PTrees. e.g. > RScript PTrees.R config will complete a call to the software and will output a file with the name specified in the configuration file. An example output can be found in the test folder. 

This sofware uses Cranefoot and Plink, both of which are cited in a file entilted citations.
